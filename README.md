# REST Assured API Testing with Gradle

### Overview
This project demonstrates API testing using **REST Assured**, a powerful Java library for testing RESTful web services. It includes automated test cases for validating API endpoints with **JUnit/TestNG**, JSON validation, authentication handling, and response assertions.

### 🔹 Features
- **Automated API Testing** – Validate RESTful APIs using REST Assured
- **JSON/XML Response Validation** – Verify response structure and data
- **Authentication Handling** – Supports OAuth, JWT, Basic, and Digest authentication
- **Parameterized Tests** – Reuse test cases with different data sets
- **Assertions & Logging** – Validate response status, headers, and body
- **CI/CD Ready** – Easily integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or any CI/CD pipeline
